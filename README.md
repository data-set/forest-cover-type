# forest-cover-type

**Goal:**<br>
Create machine learning model for predicting forest cover type.

**Dataset source:**<br>
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Covertype

**Attribute Information:**<br>
Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and a brief description. The forest cover type is the classification problem. The order of this listing corresponds to the order of numerals along the rows of the database.

Name / Data Type / Measurement / Description 

1.Elevation / quantitative /meters / Elevation in meters 

2.Aspect / quantitative / azimuth / Aspect in degrees azimuth 

3.Slope / quantitative / degrees / Slope in degrees 

4.Horizontal_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest surface water features 

5.Vertical_Distance_To_Hydrology / quantitative / meters / Vert Dist to nearest surface water features 

6.Horizontal_Distance_To_Roadways / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest roadway 

7.Hillshade_9am / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 9am, summer solstice 

8.Hillshade_Noon / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at noon, summer soltice 

9.Hillshade_3pm / quantitative / 0 to 255 index / Hillshade index at 3pm, summer solstice 

10.Horizontal_Distance_To_Fire_Points / quantitative / meters / Horz Dist to nearest wildfire ignition points 

11-14.Wilderness_Area (4 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Wilderness area designation 

15-54.Soil_Type (40 binary columns) / qualitative / 0 (absence) or 1 (presence) / Soil Type designation 

55.Cover_Type (7 types) / integer / 1 to 7 / Forest Cover Type designation
